Working hard on tackling technical debt so we improve your user experience... and how we work

## Organic Growth
Our documentation is the result of multiple people collaborating across the span of 4 years. During those years, NEAR released more and more features. At the beginning, we only had to worry about how to create [smart contracts](/build/smart-contracts/quickstart), and how to [interact with them through a frontend](/build/web3-apps/quickstart).

Fast forward to today, and NEAR accounts now tools to [easily onboard users](/build/chain-abstraction/what-is) by covering their gas, or even [control accounts on other chains](/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures). We have also growth a lot in infrastructure, having new ways to consume [historic data](/build/data-infrastructure/big-query) from the blockchain or [track it in real time](/build/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake). Our [tool ecosystem](/tools/welcome) keeps growing by the day, and we keep shipping new features every month.

But as our ecosystem grew, so did the disorganization of our documentation.

## What Link was that Again?
Soon enough, we started to notice that our docs structure was very different from our URL schemes . For example, you could be in the "Build" section reading about "What is a NEAR Component?" and the link would be `/bos/tutorial/quickstart`, but the next page would be "Setup an Environment" with URL `/bos/dev/intro`, followed by "Anatomy of a Component -> State" at `/bos/api/state`.

This inconsistency between sections, titles and URLs  was making it hard for collaborators - and us - to maintain the docs!

To modify a page, we had to first read the `sidebars.js` file, see which `id` related to the page, then locate the folder, and finally the file, which name might not match its sidebar `id`.

A true nightmare!

## Simpler Explained than Done
The solution is very simple to explain: we needed to re-organize the docs so: (i) every file within a section was in the same folder, and (ii) the title matched the URL, and hopefully its `id`.

For example, the structure of the files we named would be clearer like this:

| Title                           | Old URL                    | New URL                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| What is a NEAR Component?       | `/bos/tutorial/quickstart` | `/build/near-components/what-is`         |
| Setup an Environment            | `/bos/dev/intro`           | `/build/near-components/dev-environment` |
| Anatomy of a Component -> State | `/bos/api/state`           | `/build/near-components/anatomy/state`   |

The problem? moving files around means **updating all the internal links** that point to them. And we have a **lot of links!**. Moreover, changing the URL of a page means that all the **external links** pointing to it will break, so we need to setup **redirects**.
