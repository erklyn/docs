*We released a mayor reorganization of our repository, so we can improve docs for everyone... including us*

## Organic Growth
Our documentation is the result of multiple people collaborating across the span of four very active years. At the beginning - and I remember it because I was around - we only had to explain how to create [smart contracts](/build/smart-contracts/what-is), and how to [interact with them through a frontend](/build/web3-apps/quickstart).

Fast forward to today, and we have more than 200 pages of documentation covering topics such as [chain abstraction](/build/chain-abstraction/what-is), [on-chain components](/build/near-components/what-is), [data infrastructure](/build/data-infrastructure/what-is), [primitives such as NFT, FT](/build/primitives/what-is), and we keep shipping new features every month.

While all of this progress is truly amazing, as our ecosystem grew, so did the disorganization of our documentation.

## What Link was that Again?
Let's briefly explain how [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (the framework we use in our docs) works so you can understand the problem.

In docusaurus, all the pages are written as a simple markdown file. These files go inside the `./docs` folder, and can be organized in folders. Each file has a unique ID on its header that identifies it (e.g. `id: what-is`), and this ID alongside its folder path is used to generate the URL. 

> For example, the document [`docs/build/smart-contracts/what-is.md`](https://github.com/near/docs/blob/master/docs/2.build/2.smart-contracts/what-is.md) has the `id: what-is`, so it ends ends being served in the URL https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/what-is.

### The problem

About a year ago we noticed that our organic growth had left us with a very inconsistent URL structure. Basically, we had a lot of folders, and the files related to a same topic (e.g. NEAR components) would be all over the place.

For example, you would be in the "Build" section reading about "What is a NEAR Component?" and the URL was `/bos/tutorial/quickstart`. The next page was "Setup an Environment" located at was `/bos/dev/intro`, followed by "Anatomy of a Component -> State" at `/bos/api/state`. Talk about consistency!

Of course, we did not do this on purpose, it is just how things evolved. You might even notice that we are now talking about "NEAR Components" but the URL talks about "BOS". This is because when we started "BOS" (Blockchain Operating System) felt like a good name, but community feedback made us know that indeed, it was not. 

<!-- ## Simpler Explained than Done
What we had to do is very simple to explain. We needed to re-organize the docs so: (i) every file related to a topic was in the same folder, (ii) the files name reflected its title / id.

Using the same example as before, this was the structure we wanted to create:

| Title                        | New URL                       | Old URL                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| What is a Component?         | `/components/what-is`         | `/bos/tutorial/quickstart` |
| Developer Environment        | `/components/dev-environment` | `/bos/dev/intro`           |
| Component's Anatomy -> State | `/components/anatomy/state`   | `/bos/api/state`           |

The problem? moving files around means **updating all the internal references** that point to them. And trust me, we have lots of links!. Moreover, changing the URL scheme of a page means that all the **external links** pointing to it will break. -->

### The Migration

We have migrated almost all files to a new structure that is more consistent. This means that the URL structure of our docs is now consistent, and that you should be able to find the content you are looking for more easily.

For contributors, this also means that it is simpler to find where to add new content, removing the need to search across multiple folders trying to find the right file.

In the process, we [moved more than 200 files](https://github.com/near/docs/pull/1890/files), and updated all the internal links that pointed to them. We also added redirects to our server, so that all the old URLs will still work.

We also took the time to make sure all the [translations](https://crowdin.com/) were correctly migrated, and fixed any broken link on them. This was a huge effort, and to be honest we could write a blog post just about migrating translations in crowdin, but we will spare you the pain.

:::tip Missing URL
If you come across a URL that is not working, please let us know by using the "Feedback" button on the right side of the page, or by opening an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/near/docs/issues)

## What's Next
Now that most of our documentation is in a better shape, we can focus on improving the content itself. We have a lot of ideas on how to make the docs more interactive, and we are excited to start working on them.

Stay tuned for more updates, and remember that if you have any feedback or ideas, you can always reach out to us. We are always happy to hear from you!

See you in the next post! ðŸš€
